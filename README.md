# Hangman

- Develop a simple hangman game using Java!
- We want you to focus on demonstrating your understanding of the four pillars OOP in this project.
- Break it down into a number of classes each with their own role.
- We want you to get the classes to interact with each other!
- Some examples of classes you could have:
- A class responsible for storing your words with a method to randomly select a word.
- A class responsible for displaying the results of the guess.
- A class responsible for interacting with the player e.g. capture input, print messages.
- A class responsible for connecting these classes together and running the game.
